// Each time a salesperson sells a car at the Pardeeville New and Used Auto Dealership,
// a record is created containing the salesperson’s name and the amount of the sale.
// Sales of new and used cars are kept in separate files,
// sorted by salesperson ID number.
// Management has requested a merged file so that
// all of a salesperson’s sales (both new and used cars) are displayed together.
